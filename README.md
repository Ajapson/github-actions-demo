# GitHub Actions Demo

This is a basic demo of GitHub Actions created for my **Data Stack Problem-First Comparison Assignment**.

### Purpose

To show how a simple GitHub Action can automatically run tasks like printing messages or building/testing code whenever new code is pushed to the repository.

### What it does

When I push a change to this repository, GitHub Actions runs a workflow that prints:

> ðŸ‘‹ Hello from GitHub Actions!

This demonstrates how Continuous Integration (CI) works without any external tools or plugins.

### Trigger Test

âœ… Triggered via this README update.
